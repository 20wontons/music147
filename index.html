                    A Max project that takes <b>keyboard input</b> of typing my name ("antoine nguyen") to <b>play sound 
                    files</b> for each character that arranges to be a familiar melody!
                    <br />I implemented a <b>queuing system</b> to ensure that the melody would only play when the
                    correct order of characters for my name is inputted.
                    If an incorrect character is inputted, the queue is reset and an error sound plays. When the
                    complete sequence of characters is inputted, a completion sound plays.

                    A web app that allows you to create a melody using an oscillator and an accompanying breakbeat. 
                    The UI allows you to view your melody in a piano roll style grid.
                    <br/> Unfortunately due to issues figuring out local testing of sound files using WebAudioAPI,
                    I was not able to switch the oscillator melody out for sound files as I had originally envisioned.

                    A Max project that takes <b>MIDI input</b>, i.e. from a MIDI controller and plays sounds.
                    <br/>The keys on the MIDI controller play a sound file that is pitchshifted based on the corresponding semitone away from middle C.
                    <br/>Pads 1 and 2 play kick drum and snare drum samples, respectively.
                    <br/>The modulation wheel controls <b>amplitude modulation</b> (tremolo).
                    <br/>The first fader controls volume.

                    A Max project that generates a melody over a drum beat. 
                    <br/>The melody is randomly generated over 3 octaves of the C major scale, favoring the pentatonic notes more.
                    <br/>The drum beat consists of a kick, snare, and cymbal, played in a simple syncopated rhythm, at 190bpm.
                    The snare maintains the 2 and 4. The kick randomly adds additional kicks on the beats that aren't in the main rhythm.
                    The cymbal randomly generates and simulates a choking kind of sound, where it stops cleanly.
